# Work Day Scheduling, Made Easy

# Why, What and How is it?


## Why?
At-A-Glance information. Simple click interface. We need to simplify our lives and one of the easiest ways to accomplish that goal is to take our schedules out of our heads and put them down on our screens.


## What?
This release shows you your work day by hour and allows you to add notes or specific appointment data in the hourly blocks. When you have noted what you want, you hit "save" to keep that information. (If you change your mind, delete your note and "save" the cleared field - no accidental deletions!)

## How?
Using an append statement in JavaScript, the timeblock container is loaded row-by-row, similar to the way a password might be built from several different character type selections, rather than in separate hourly code blocks. This serves to streamline and simplify the code base. Moment.js is used to grab current time information.


## What else do I need to know?
The Easy Work Day Scheduler also keeps track of the time during the day and shows different colors based on where you are during the day (past hours are grey, present is red and future are green). (The screenshot below shows grey hours because of the time of day it was taken - but, the colors really do work!) Cheers!
