# Work Day Scheduling, Made Easy

# Why, What and How is it?


## Why?
At-A-Glance information. Simple, click interface. As previously discussed, we need to simplify our lives and one of the easiest ways to accomplish that goal is to take our schedules out of our heads and put them down on screens.


## What?
This release helps you to create an unpatterned (therefore, unpredictable) password while allowing you to define what criteria to apply to it. These criteria include:
- Length (between 8-128 characters)
Types of Characters:
- Numbers
- Special Characters
- Lowercase Characters
- Uppercase Characters


## How?
A very lightweight and simple combination of html/css/js combined with a straightforward alert-driven question/response interface with the ability to generate as many different versions as you want and copy/paste the ones you want, directly addresses the 'simplicity' requirement noted in the Why section above.


## What else do I need to know?
Thanks for asking! Something helpful built into this generator is a collection of feedback alerts associated with the "password length" request. If the entry does not meet the criteria (too short, too long, nothing or not a number), clarification alerts appear and bring you back to the start page. Overall, this meets the need for the simple complex life. Cheers!

I worked on this with some base code from my Boot Camp (Trilogy Education Services) but the cool stuff is mine.
